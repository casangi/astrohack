    .. _Description:

        Each Stokes I aperture image in the input image file is processed in the following steps:
        
        .. rubric:: Code Outline
        - Phase image is converted to a physical surface deviation image.
        - A mask of valid signals is created by using the relative cutoff on the amplitude image.
        - From telescope panel and layout information, an image describing the panel assignment of each pixel is created
        - Using panel image and mask, a list of pixels in each panel is created.
        - Pixels in each panel are divided into two groups: margin pixels and internal pixels.
        - For each panel:
            * Internal pixels are fitted to a surface model.
            * The fitted surface model is used to derive corrections for all pixels in the panel, internal and margins.
            * The fitted surface model is used to derive corrections for the positions of the screws.
        - A corrected deviation image is produced.
        - RMS is computed for both the corrected and uncorrected deviation images.
        - All images produced are stored in the output *.panel.zarr file*.

        .. rubric:: Available panel surface models:
        * AIPS fitting models:
            - *mean*: The panel is corrected by the mean of its samples.
            - *rigid*: The panel samples are fitted to a rigid surface (DEFAULT model).
        * Corotated Paraboloids: (the two bending axes of the paraboloid are parallel and perpendicular to a radius \
        of the antenna crossing the middle point of the panel):
            - *corotated_scipy*: Paraboloid is fitted using scipy.optimize, robust but slow.
            - *corotated_lst_sq*: Paraboloid is fitted using the linear algebra least squares method, fast but \
            unreliable.
            - *corotated_robust*: Tries corotated_lst_sq, if it diverges falls back to corotated_scipy, fast and robust.
        * Experimental fitting models:
            - *xy_paraboloid*: fitted using scipy.optimize, bending axes are parallel to the x and y axes.
            - *rotated_paraboloid*: fitted using scipy.optimize, bending axes can be rotated by any arbitrary angle.
            - *full_paraboloid_lst_sq*: Full 9 parameter paraboloid fitted using least_squares method, tends to \
            heavily overfit surface irregularities.

        .. rubric:: Amplitude clipping:

        In order to produce results of good quality parts of the aperture with low signal (e.g. the shadow of the
        secondary mirror support) a mask is defined based on the amplitude of the aperture. There are 3 methods
        (clip_type parameter) available to define at which level (clip_level) the amplitude is clipped:

        * absolute: In this method the clipping value is taken directly from the clip_level parameter, e.g.:
                    if the user calls `panel(..., clip_type='absolute', clip_level=3.5)` everything below 3.5 in
                    amplitude will be clipped
        * relative: In this method the clipping value is derived from the amplitude maximum, e.g.: if the user calls
                    `panel(..., clip_type='relative', clip_level=0.2) everything below 20% of the maximum amplitude will
                    be clipped
        * sigma;    In this method the clipping value is computed from the RMS noise in the amplitude outside the
                    physical dish, e.g.: if the user calls `panel(clip_type='sigma', clip_level=3)` everything below 3
                    times the RMS noise in amplitude will be clipped.

        The default clipping is set to 3 sigma.


    .. _Description:
    **AstrohackPanelFile**
    Panel object allows the user to access panel data via compound dictionary keys with values, in order of depth, \
    `ant` -> `ddi`. The panel object also provides a `summary()` helper function to list available keys for each file.\
     An outline of the panel object structure is show below:

    .. parsed-literal::
        panel_mds = 
        {
            ant_0:{
                ddi_0: panel_ds,
                 ⋮               
                ddi_m: panel_ds
            },
            ⋮
            ant_n: …
        }
